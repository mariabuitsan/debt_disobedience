        <p id="explicacion">When we speak of debt, we place particular emphasis on private debt or what we will call indebted household economies... Today, finance lands in household economies, in popular economies, and waged economies through mass indebtedness and it does so in ways that are specific to each one of those economies. Our perspective is based on a tripartite wager. First, we want to highlight the fact that we cannot understand debt in its contemporary form only by looking at public debt (debt taken out by the state), while ignoring indebtedness in everyday life. Second, it is politically necessary for social movements and organizations to take the issue of debt into account in their resistance practices. And third, talking about debt in everyday life brings us to a strategic task: tracing the links between debt and sexist violence. By doing this, contemporary feminist struggles are leading a movement of the politicization and collectivization of the issue of finance</p><p><a href="https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745341729/a-feminist-reading-of-debt/">Cavallero, L., & Gago, V.
